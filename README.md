This is a mess because it was made in a hurry.

There are a number of things I need to fix/work on:
1. Authorisation. Authentication is implemented, but there are still resources that are not properly secured. I am likely to restructure my resources so that authorisation only needs to be done on at the top node.
2. Cleaner code.
3. Better pagination
4. Presence.
5. More tests.
6. I need to work out how to seed when I deploy with docker.
